Task : 3 - IRIS Flower Classification - Aim of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the category of Iris flower based on dataset downloaded from the Kaggle website as per Codsoft instructions for this project. In this project, I have implemented multiple classification algorithm with Python and Scikit-Learn. Accuracy of the model is calculated and established with the help of Evaluation Metrics. As a result of these process, we found Random Forest Classifier algorithm has higher performance efficiency in train but Logistic Regression model has better accuracy in both Train and Test data.
